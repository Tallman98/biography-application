      <p>
        I'm a student of Frontend engineering at Altschool Africa, I also work
        as a Frontend engineering intern at
        <a href="https://aellaapp.com/" class="text-[blue]">Aella App</a>. Prior
        to enrolling at altschool, I had already gotten some knowledge of the
        fundamentals of HTML, CSS (Vanilla and TailwindCSS) and Javascript, with
        an introductory knowledge of ReactJs. When i started my internship, i
        was introducted to typescript and the Nextjs which happens to be the
        language and framework being used there, and as such I'm currently
        contributing to ongoing company projects on production.
      </p>
      <h2 class="font-[600] text-lg my-3">Reason for joining Altschool</h2>
      <p>
        I attended a 3-months long virtual bootcamp which introduced me to the
        basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. After the bootcamp ended, I had to
        learn more on my own mostly with aid of youtube tutorials and not really
        had a well structured plan to learning these technologies, which is why
        I decided to enroll at Altschool Africa so I can get properly trained to
        be a well grounded Frontend engineer.
      </p>

        What I plan to acheive with Altschool
      </h2>
      <p>
        I plan to leverage on the wealth of knowledge of the various instructors
        to get as much as possible, as well as to collaborate on projects, build
        networks and possibly lasting relationships with fellow altschoolers.
